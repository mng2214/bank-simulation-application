Bank Application
This is a full-stack Java enterprise application integrating Jakarta EE (Enterprise Edition) for building web-based enterprise applications and Spring MVC for establishing an effective framework centric to web application development. The application demonstrates fruitful enterprise-level features developed with the Java SDK version 17.
Throughout this project, Lombok was incorporated for reducing boilerplate code which deals with things like getter, setter, and toString methods that are essential but do redundant jobs. This way, we aimed to improve readability and significantly decrease the code length.
